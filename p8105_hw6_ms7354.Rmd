###Question 2

```{r data setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(p8105.datasets)

```

### Problem 1

```{r}

homicide_df = homicide_daf |>
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city,state, sep = ","),
    solved = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
    )
